  "summary": "The diff shows a comprehensive visual redesign across many frontend components. Most requirements of REQ-1 appear to be addressed — components like AppHeader, BottomNav, HeroSection, ListingCard, and many others have been restyled. However, the diff summary notes that 22 modified files were omitted due to limits, meaning we cannot confirm all acceptance criteria directly. Key files like index.css and tailwind.config.js (where the new color palette should be defined) are not visible in the diff, nor are the page-level files (HomeFeed, ListingDetail, Profile, Search, Chat). The visible components do use CSS custom properties (--primary, --accent, --brand-coral, etc.) and new typography classes (font-display, font-body), suggesting a theme system exists, but we cannot confirm the palette fully replaces OKLCH tokens or that dark mode variants are updated without seeing index.css/tailwind.config.js.",

      "reason": "Neither index.css nor tailwind.config.js appear in the diff summary. The HeroSection component still uses raw OKLCH tokens inline, suggesting OKLCH tokens may not have been fully replaced in the central config files.",
