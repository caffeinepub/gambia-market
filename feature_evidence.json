Once dismissed or installed, hide the banner and persist the dismissal in localStorage so it does not reappear in the same session. For iOS (detected via user agent), show a separate instructional banner with the text 'Tap the Share button then \"Add to Home Screen\" to install' with a share icon illustration. Style the banner using the app's West African-inspired color theme (brand green background, gold/amber accent text).",
