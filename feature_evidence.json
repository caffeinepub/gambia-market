Users can 'Like' individual listings (heart icon on each listing card and detail page) and 'Follow' a seller from their PublicProfile or Listing Detail page. In the backend, add a `followSeller` function that records follower/following relationships (followerId → sellerId) and an `unfollowSeller` function to remove the relationship. Add a `likeListingAnon` / `likeListing` function to toggle a like on a listing, storing the liker's principal and the listing ID. Expose query functions `getFollowing`, `getFollowers`, and `getLikedListings`. In the Profile page, add a 'Following' tab showing followed sellers. Display follower counts on seller profiles and like counts on listing cards.",

Since the platform uses principal-based identity (Google/Apple), the same identity resolves to the same principal across devices, so data is inherently cross-device.
