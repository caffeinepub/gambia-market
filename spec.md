# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the visual theme of the Gambia Market app with a fresh, cohesive aesthetic replacing the current dark mode implementation.

**Planned changes:**
- Define a new color palette and typography in `index.css` and `tailwind.config.js`, replacing existing OKLCH tokens
- Apply the new theme consistently across all pages: HomeFeed, ListingDetail, Profile, Search, and Chat
- Update shared components: AppHeader, BottomNav, HeroSection, and ListingCard to reflect the new visual style
- Update both light and dark mode variants to use the new palette
- Ensure clean, organized layout and spacing on mobile and desktop viewports

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays a refreshed, consistent visual design with a new color scheme and typography across all pages and components.
