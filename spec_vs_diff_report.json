  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements. REQ-1 (CreateListing fix), REQ-2 (Profile page with avatar/edit), REQ-3 (My Listings section), REQ-4 (Reviews section with stats), and REQ-5 (backend ExternalBlob avatar) are all addressed. However, REQ-4's aggregate stats row is referenced via a ProfileStatsRow component that is not included in the diff, making it unverifiable. Overall coverage is strong with minor gaps in verifiable evidence.",
